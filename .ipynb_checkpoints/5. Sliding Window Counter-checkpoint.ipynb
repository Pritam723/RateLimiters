    "# This algorithm combines the Fixed Window Counter and Sliding Window Log \n",
    "# approaches for a more accurate and efficient solution. Instead of keeping \n",
    "# track of every single requestâ€™s timestamp as the sliding log does, it focus\n",
    "# on the number of requests from the last window. So, if you are in 75% of \n",
    "# the current window, 25% of the weight would come from the previous window,\n",
    "# and the rest from the current one:\n",
    "# In such cases weight will be calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "# weight = (100 - 75)% * lastWindowRequests + currentWindowRequests\n",
    "# Now, when a new request comes, you add one to that weight (weight + 1).\n",
    "# If this new total crosses our set limit, we have to reject the request.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Algorithm:\n",
    "# i) Keep track of request count for the current and previous window.\n",
    "# ii) Calculate the weighted sum of requests based on the overlap with the sliding window.\n",
    "# iii) If the weighted sum is less than the limit, allow the request.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Note. To calculate the overlap, we can use simple maths.\n",
    "# Ex. Previous window had 3 req. Current window till now has 4 req and 60% of the \n",
    "# current window has elapsed. So we calculate 3*0.4 + 4 = 5 (Can be taken 6 if we are strict)\n",
    "# And now a req is coming, we basically we will have 6 req in this window. Surely,\n",
    "# it will only be served if maxReq >= 6. Otherwise it will be dropped.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ex. how to calculate how much window has elapsed? Say windowSize = 10 seconds.\n",
    "# Our windows are like this: 0-9 (Window-0), 10-19 (Window-1), 20-29 (Window-2) etc.\n",
    "# So, If we are at second = 24, so it is 24/10 = window no. 2. But how much time has passed?\n",
    "# 24 % 10 = 4, so elapsed = 4/10 = 0.4 i.e., 40%. So, previous window to consider is 60%."
